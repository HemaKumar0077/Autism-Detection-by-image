# Autism-Detection-by-image
This project creates a machine learning system to detect autism through image analysis. It examines facial features and expressions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify autism-related cues. The goal is to provide a user-friendly tool for early and accurate autism detection, supporting timely interventions.
